### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)
# What was the 2018 salary of Employee 57
# How many employees got a raise?
# What was the dollar value of the highest raise?
# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
# What was the average salary change?
# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose on average?
## Consider: do the above averages match what you expected them to be based on
## how you generated the salaries?
# Write a .csv file of your salary data to your working directory
# Add a column to the `salaries` data frame that represents each person's
# salary in 2018 (e.g., with the salary adjustment added in).
